1. Profanity Detection in a Facebook post.

This is our final Project 

Proposal:
There are many kinds of barriers people are facing on socialmedia and Facebook is no exception. 
Harsh words and abusive language are one of these barriers. 
So, we are going to create a simple prototype for detecting and removing this barrier.



Steps and models included:
On the first stage, we have decided to divide our prototype into 4 stages.
1) Create simple scraper to scrape Facebook post.(text data Only).
2) Apply pre-processing tasks to clean that data.
3) Create profanity algorithm to detect violation (Using NLP algorithm).
4) Merge scraped data to our algorithm.
